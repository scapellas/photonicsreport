# Photonics report: solar sails
The script 'main.m' computes both Sub-L1 and L1 equilibrium distances from the Sun for NASA's Solar Cruiser. The function 'quintic.m' computes the solution to a quintic equation derived from Newton's Second Law, in order to find these equilibrium points. A further explanation can be found in the report pdf.
